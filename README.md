# BP Thesis

LaTeX class for our bachelor thesis at the Hasso Plattner Institute


## Usage

As described in http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/34203/where-to-put-sty-and-cls-file-for-project
the best way to use this class is to move it to your `texmf` directory.


## Development

Everytime the class document is changed the date in the `\ProvidesClass`
section must be updated.
Either to the date of the change or if there are several changes on
the same day it can simply be incremented by one day.
